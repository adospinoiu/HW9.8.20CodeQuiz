# HW9.8.20CodeQuiz

This is a quiz with seven questions based on coding.

There is a timer that will start counting down once the quiz is started.

A wrong answer will deduct from the time. A right answer will not result in a deduction.

At the end of the quiz, a field will appear to enter your initials and log the score (i.e. the remaining time).

Scores will be stored in local storage.

High Scores Link (*should*) direct you to the list of scores.
